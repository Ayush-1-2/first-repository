## **What is a Dot Product?**

The dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (vectors) and returns a single number. It is defined mathematically as:

$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i
$

Where:

- $( \mathbf{a} )$ and $( \mathbf{b} )$ are vectors.
- $( a_i )$ and $( b_i )$ are the components of the vectors.

## **Code Implementation**

Below is a Python implementation of the vector dot-product algorithm:

```python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    if len(vector_a) != len(vector_b):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")
    return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector_a, vector_b))

# Example usage:
vector_a = [1, 2, 3]
vector_b = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector_a, vector_b)
print("Dot Product:", result)
```
